        <!--History Section-->
        <div class="history reveal">
            <p>Balay Gulay started in 2015 as a small scale walk in vegetable store exclusive to the residents of Village East. Its humble beginnings focused on providing fresh, locally sourced produce to nearby houses. As months went by, Balay Gulay gradually expanded its reach by offering delivery services outside the village, allowing more customers to enjoy its fresh vegetables.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, during the pandemic, the walk-in store was forced to close due to health and safety restrictions. Despite the challenges, Balay Gulay continued its operations through delivery services, ensuring that customers still had access to fresh and healthy vegetables during those difficult times.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2022, Balay Gulay made a comeback by reopening its walk-in store, marking a new chapter of growth and community connection. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen issues and challenges, the store had to permanently close its physical location. Since then, Balay Gulay has fully shifted to a delivery based business model, catering to individual clients and supplying vegetables to various companies and restaurants such as Hapag, Blake’s, Big Mama, and more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Today, Balay Gulay continues to thrive as a trusted supplier of fresh produce, staying true to its mission of delivering quality and sustainability straight to its customers’ doors.</p>
